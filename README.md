Welcome to the Practice Linux File Permissions repository! This is a show of my own practice of using read, write, and execute permissions in linux

## What are File Permissions?

In Linux and Unix-like operating systems, file permissions determine who can read, write, and execute files and directories. Understanding and managing file permissions is crucial for maintaining security and controlling access to sensitive data.

## Basic File Permissions
- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: Users who belong to the file's group.
- **Others**: Everyone else.

Each set of permissions consists of three characters:

- **r**: Read permission allows reading the contents of the file.
- **w**: Write permission allows modifying the file's contents.
- **x**: Execute permission allows executing the file (for executable programs or scripts) or accessing a directory.
